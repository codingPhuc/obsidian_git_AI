A* Search is a popular search algorithm used in computer science and artificial intelligence. It is a type of best-first search algorithm that combines the benefits of Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Greedy Best-First Search (GBFS).

Like BFS, A* Search visits nodes in a graph by expanding the node that appears closest to the goal. Unlike BFS, A* Search uses an additional cost function to guide its search, making it more efficient and effective in finding the optimal solution. This cost function is called the "heuristic" and represents an estimate of the distance from a given node to the goal.

The algorithm keeps track of two values for each node: the actual cost from the starting node to that node, and the estimated cost from that node to the goal. The sum of these two costs is used to guide the search and determine which node to expand next. Nodes are expanded in the order of their estimated total cost, with the node having the lowest estimated total cost being expanded first.

A* Search is commonly used in pathfinding and navigation problems, such as finding the shortest path in a maze or on a map. It is also used in game playing, where it can be used to determine the best move in a game.

In conclusion, A* Search is a powerful search algorithm that balances the trade-off between finding an optimal solution and efficiency by using an estimated cost function.
