## ATOMIC SENTENCE 
Atomic sentence = predicate(term , .. term)

## complex sentences 
A complex sentences are made from atomic sentences using connectives 
for example : 
- $\lnot$ Brother(leftleg(Richard), john )
- Brother(Richard , john)$\land$ 

## quantifiers : Universal quantification 
expression of general rules 
- it is equivalent to the conjunction of instantiations of P 
	- Student(lan , FIt )-> Smart(Lan)
	- Student(Tuan , Fit)-> Smart(Long)
	- .. 
### varible 
- a variable is a term all by itself and able to serve as the argument of a function 
- usually represented by lowercase letters 
- A term with no vaiables is called a ground term 
types of logics


## Existential quantification 
expressionds of "some cases" $\exists$ varible> sentence>
it is equivalent to the disjunction of instantiations of P

## nested quantifiers 
multiplbe quantifiers enable more complex sentences 
Mixture 

$\forall$x (Crown(x))$\lor$ ($\exists$ x Brother(Richard,x))
Rule : the caiable belong to the innermost quantifier that mentions it (meaning that you take the closet x)
## QUANTIFIER DUALITY 
- $\forall$ $\exists$ relate to each other through negation 
- for example 
## Equality symbol = 
term1  = term2 is true under a given interpretation iff terms1 and term2 refer to the same object
