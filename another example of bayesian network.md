## conditional probability table 
each row contains the conditional probability of each node value for a conditional 
- each row much be sum 1 
- A ndoe with no parent has only one row , representing the prior probabilieties of each possible value of variable 
this


### inference 



p(x1,x2, .. , xn) =TCP(xi|parent(xi)
