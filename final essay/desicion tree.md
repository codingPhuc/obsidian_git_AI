bases on this video : [Decision Tree Classification Clearly Explained! - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVR2Way4nwQ)

the decsion tree is a tree that can sort out node that are diffrent form each other
- the sort in the decision tree should take out all node that are of diffrent color 
- it should slipt the data into optimal root 
-> the machine need to learn which slipt to choose 
![[de.PNG]]
- the tree should choose the second spilt because it have the purest data slipt that being all red as apose to the first spilt which is a combination of both green and red 
### information gain 

- to know the purity of the data set we will used entropy it is gain of information in a state $entropy=\sum_{}^{}-pi log(pi)$ 
![[log.PNG]]
the highest entopy being one and the lowest being 0
$-0.33log(0.33)-0.67log(0.67)
then we will apply the information gain
