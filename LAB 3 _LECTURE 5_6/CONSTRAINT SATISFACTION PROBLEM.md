#sumarize  
constraint satisfaction problem is use when you are making a bunch of decision in parallee and you can model those decisionwith varible 


#varieties_Cps 
## DISCRETE VARIABLES 
### FINITE DOMAINS :
- N VARIBLES , D
#execution
let say that that we set of varible X1 , X2 , X3 ,X4 
each varible have a set of domain like Xi have domain of {1,2,3,4,5}
each domain have a set of contraints 
- ex the contrains of Xi is the it does not have the number 3(unary constrain) and does not have the x3 < x4 (binary constrain)
the solution to sloving  is the assgin a value to each varible so that the constraints are broken 
this use the algorithm : [[backtracking]] or [[Forward checking]]
