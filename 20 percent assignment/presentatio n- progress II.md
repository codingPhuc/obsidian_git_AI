Players color cells by red or green so that the number of green cells which are “adjacent” to a cell is exactly the number inside. ? 
- what does this mean ? 
- how do each number combind create an out put or an input 
- what does exactly the number inside mean ? 
Use propositional logic to solve the problem 
Assign a propositional symbol to each cell (true -> green, false -> red)
 Enumerate cells to generate CNF clauses representing constraints.
 - how does a positional logic slove this problem ?
 - (true -> green, false -> red) how do we know what is true and what is false 
 - what does enumerate cells mean and how does it generate CNF 
 Find a model satisfying all clauses using Glucose3 of PySAT.
 - what is Glucose3 of PySat ?
